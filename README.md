# Meal-Tracking App
The app will feature a customizable calendar for users to track their breakfast, lunch, and dinner through the week. Users will leverage Edamam's Recipe Search API to add meals, then generate a shopping list of ingredients based on the meals chosen.

### TL;DR

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
